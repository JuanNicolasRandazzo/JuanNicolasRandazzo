## 👨‍💻 Nico's coding journey

My journey began in 2018 when I took my first Python course while pursuing my Bachelor’s degree in Astronomy. There, I learned the basic concepts of programming and Python. I spent three years developing my skills in this language before deciding to study programming professionally. I enrolled at LaSalle College in Montreal to study Information Technology Programmer-Analyst. My studies included C#, Java, Python, SQL, .NET, .NET Core, GoLang, Android, and iOS. We created numerous projects through which I learned a lot, some of which you can find in this portfolio.

Currently, I am fully immersed in the world of development and programming, creating my own applications while seeking job opportunities to further develop my professional career.
